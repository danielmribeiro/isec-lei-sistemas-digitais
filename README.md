# Sistemas Digitais (Digital Systems)
Repository for the "Sistemas Digitais" course at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC), part of the "Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática" degree program. This repository contains exercises, resources, and materials related to the study of Digital Systems


## Course Objectives
This course aims to provide students with the necessary skills to understand the components of a computer at the level of digital electronic circuits. Specifically, students should master the fundamental concepts of combinational and sequential circuits, along with analysis and synthesis techniques.

## Competencies
Upon completing this course, students should be able to:
- Master fundamental concepts such as Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, binary numbering systems, and binary codes.
- Understand basic physical components such as logic gates, dedicated combinational circuits, and Flip-Flops.
- Design low-complexity combinational and sequential circuits using formal analysis and synthesis techniques.
- Implement low-complexity combinational and sequential circuits.
- Prepare clear and objective documentation for developed projects.
- Work independently on practical assignments.

## Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation consists of two components:
- Practical Component – Completion of three practical assignments
    - Weight: 6 points (out of 20) in the final grade.
- Written Component – Final Exam
    - Weight: 14 points (out of 20) in the final grade.
    - Minimum required score: 35%.
