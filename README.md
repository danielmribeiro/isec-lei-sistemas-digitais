# Sistemas Digitais (Digital Systems)
Repository for the "Sistemas Digitais" course at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC), part of the "Licenciatura em Engenharia Inform√°tica" degree program. This repository contains exercises, resources, and materials related to the study of Digital Systems

## Course Objectives
This course aims to provide students with the necessary skills to understand the components of a computer at the level of digital electronic circuits. Specifically, students should master the fundamental concepts of combinational and sequential circuits, along with analysis and synthesis techniques.

## Competencies
Upon completing this course, students should be able to:
- Master fundamental concepts such as Boolean algebra, Karnaugh maps, binary numbering systems, and binary codes.
- Understand basic physical components such as logic gates, dedicated combinational circuits, and Flip-Flops.
- Design low-complexity combinational and sequential circuits using formal analysis and synthesis techniques.
- Implement low-complexity combinational and sequential circuits.
- Prepare clear and objective documentation for developed projects.
- Work independently on practical assignments.
